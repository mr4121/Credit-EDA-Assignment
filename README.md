# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis – EDA Case Study

## 📖 Overview

This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to a credit risk dataset, aiming to identify patterns that indicate a client's ability to repay loans. The analysis assists in making informed lending decisions, such as approving loans, adjusting loan amounts, or setting interest rates based on risk assessments.

## 🔍 Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigate relationships between features and target variables.
- **Risk Assessment:** Identify patterns that predict loan repayment capabilities.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comprises three CSV files:

1. `application_data.csv`: Contains client information at the time of application.
2. `previous_application.csv`: Details of the client's previous loan applications.
3. `columns_description.csv`: A data dictionary describing the variables.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Risk Indicators:** Identification of features correlating with loan repayment difficulties
- **Data Imbalance:** Analysis of class distribution and its impact on model performance
- **Feature Importance:** Determination of significant variables influencing credit risk
